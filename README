Compiler that compiles a subset of C to MIPS
What's supported:
	* types: struct,
		* int (4 byte),
		* char (1 byte),
		* pointer (4 byte),
		* array (pointer),
		* string (0 terminated char array)
	* arithmetic operators: +-*/ (including pointer arithmetic)
	* sizeof -- NOTE: due to my impatience and idiocy, `sizeof` only works for expressions. i.e. `sizeof(type_name)` won't work
	* '++' and '--' operators 
	* logical operator: not, and, or
	* function
	* loops - for/while (no do-while)
	* if
	* types 
	* line and block comment
	* builtin (magic) funcitons
		* print_str
		* print_int
		* sbrk
