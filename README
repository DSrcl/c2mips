Compiler that compiles a subset of C to MIPS
What's supported:
    * types: struct,
        int (4 byte),
        char (1 byte),
        pointer (4 byte),
        array (pointer),
        string (0 terminated char array)
    * arithmetic operators: +-*/ (including pointer arithmetic)
    * ++ and -- operators 
    * logical operator: not, and, or
    * function
    * loops - for/while (no do-while)
    * if
    * types 
    * line and block comment
    * builtin (magic) funcitons
        * print_str
        * print_int

What's not supported/limitations:
	* struct can't be return value -- do this by passing in struct pointer to receive return value
    * NO floating point calculation (at least not yet)
    * gotos
    * sizeof -- you don't really need this if you don't do allocate memory on the heap anyway
    * function pointer
    * switch statement
    * to simplify the parser, only decimal constants are supported
    * typecast
    * ternary operator
    * typedef
    * declaration list (e.g. "int a, b" is not allowed and "int a; int b;" should be used instead)
    * all function declaration's arguments should be named -- e.g. "int add(int, int);" is not allowed and "int add(int a, int b)" should be used instead
